# Faenza Icons Theme for `h5ai`

The official [`h5ai-themes`][1] repository has a version of [`faenza`][2],
but it uses PNG files and looks blurry when zoomed in.

This version of the `faenza` theme is based on the SVG files, and will not
be blurry when zoomed in.

Original author is Matthieu James, and the icons are licensed under GPL.

I hope you find this useful.
